# ReadMe-Generator

## Description

This week in coding bootcamp, our homework assignemnt was to build a high quality README.md genertor using the principals learnt within Node. Our motivation to create this generator is to improve the standard of README's we submit in our repos. We want a seamless experience for our users, inclusive of simple prompts and standard README headings. 
We want to give the users an ability to describe their repos by completing a basic questionaire that subsequently populates answers to the markdown file we have generated. 
Our README files will include links to access seperate sections of the page and an ability to select specific licences used.
